# Real-Time Emotion Classification in MATLAB 🎭

This project performs **real-time facial emotion recognition** using MATLAB. It uses a webcam feed, detects faces using the `vision.CascadeObjectDetector`, and classifies the detected emotion using a pretrained machine learning model.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Real-time webcam-based emotion classification
- Face detection using MATLAB's built-in Haar cascade
- Emotion prediction with a pretrained model
- On-screen annotations for emotion labels

## 🧠 How It Works
1. Connect to the webcam.
2. Detect faces in each video frame.
3. Resize and preprocess the face.
4. Extract features (or use raw pixel data).
5. Use a trained model to classify emotion (e.g., Happy, Sad, Angry).
6. Display label and bounding box on the frame.
